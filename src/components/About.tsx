            </h2>
            <p className="text-realsync-darkgray mb-4">
              Founded by a team of experienced hardware and software engineers, RealSync emerged from our own struggles with hardware-in-the-loop testing across distributed teams.
            </p>
            <p className="text-realsync-darkgray mb-4">
              We realized that as engineering teams become increasingly distributed, the need for remote hardware testing capabilities was growing exponentially. Traditional solutions were expensive, complicated, and often required shipping physical hardware between locations.
            </p>
            <p className="text-realsync-darkgray mb-4">
              Our technology bridges the gap between simulation environments and physical hardware, enabling seamless remote testing with ultra-low latency. This allows engineering teams to collaborate effectively regardless of their physical location.
            </p>
            {/* <p className="text-realsync-darkgray">
              Today, RealSync solutions are used by leading companies in automotive, aerospace, industrial automation, and energy sectors to accelerate their development cycles and improve product quality.
